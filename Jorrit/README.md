# Portfolio of Jorrit
My portfolio.

I didn't split the lab notes and the reflections up into different files, both are in the reflections.

## First Week
- [Reflections](/Jorrit/reflections/week1/)

- [Lecture assignments](/Jorrit/assignments/week1/)

## Second Week
- [Reflections](/Jorrit/reflections/week2/)

- [Lecture assignments](/Jorrit/assignments/week2/)

## Third Week
- [Reflections](/Jorrit/reflections/week3/)

- [Lecture assignments](/Jorrit/assignments/week3/)

Some of my work was saved by others, but I don't know why they chose to record it as they did.
[Here's the file](/TeamThree/Ulrichs%20Lab%20Tasks.md), [and the other one.](/TeamThree/Volkers%20Part.md) What even are github assets, and why are all the links dead?
