# Reflections

## Lecture
I do not remember what we discussed this morning, probably the final project.

## Final Project
I worked on the final project. I worked out a simple design on my own and started working on it. I finished a pretty decent Node-RED flow by the end of the day. I've attempted to describe the final project [here](/TeamThree/Ulrichs%20Lab%20Tasks.md), but the code for it is stored in a Raspberry Pi, just over 1 Germany away from us and nobody bothered to back it up (hello from Belgium).

## Opinions
- I'm not looking to throw anyone under the bus, but my teammates did not bother to use git properly. I'm not using it properly either because there's no point in making meaningful commits or using branches if everyone else is literally just using the web interface to make changes. I shouldn't be overly judgemental, but I find it quite remarkable that a majority of our classmates don't know how to work with git and don't want to learn either. It seems like such a basic thing.
