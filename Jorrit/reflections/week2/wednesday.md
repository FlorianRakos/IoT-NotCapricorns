# Reflections

## Lecture
I was late and hungover. I drank a coke the night before that I suspect had rum in it. It tasted a bit off, but I didn't think much of it. Unfortunately I never drink, so my tolerance is basically in the negatives. Apparently I missed some type of discussion in the morning.

## Final Project
It tried to get the voice activation thing going, but it wasn't going anywhere. I can finish it later. Instead I explained the flow I'd made to Gift.

## Opinions
- I don't understand why people like alcohol. I don't enjoy the feeling of being disinhibited, it doesn't taste good, it's not healthy, it's expensive, and hangovers are not worth any amount of pleasure one might have in drinking.
