# Reflections

## Lecture
The lecture took a bit of a left turn from the previous one. We changed subject to Story Driven Modeling. This is also something I learned, but even further in the past during my previous uni course. I don't have much of an opinion on methods like these. I find them tedious, but I also recognise that it's a very good tool for making sure stakeholders and developers are on the same page. I admit I skipped the first task in favour of sending emails to mechanics in Spain because my injured car is stranded there.

## Lab
We started work on getting the raspberry Pi up and running. We had some trouble downloading the etcher and the image because the internet was troublesome. The steps themselves weren't difficult, especially since we can just copy the example video (which is the case for most of our lab exercises).

### exercise 3a
This exercise is quite familiar to me, I spent time to explaining it to my teammates and getting them involved. I was once again confronted with the task of programming a toggle button. I decided the 1 second delay was good enough.

### exercise 3b
We wrote a story about one of our personas using one of the products we're planning to create. I'm not sure I learned that much, but we were complimented on it.

## Opinions

- The lack of time is going to be a theme.
