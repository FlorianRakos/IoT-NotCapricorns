## Final Project
Florian and I got to work on the final project again with Gift spectating.
We made a new flow for the listener because I don't know how to use the iotempower platform to do the manipulations I want. This, children, is when a tool becomes a crutch. Unfortunately I have a very special BMW-shaped friend waiting for me in Spain and need to get going before the day is over.
With some guidance from our talented and impatient instructor, I added a microphone function to the ui. It definitely doesn't work; it says that my input is 0 seconds long, which it shouldn't be.

Florian got on my tits a little. He kept fighting a non-functional buzzer for like an hour, even though there were other things that still needed his attention. We all need to learn the lesson that hardware sometimes fights you for no particular reason and investing more time in it is not going to fix anything.

The M5 sticks ended up basically bricking themselves. I added comments to the Node-RED flow to explain it. I expect to be called tomorrow for clarification.
