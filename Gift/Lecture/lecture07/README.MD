### Usecase/story update for final project
On this day we discussed with lectures on how we can implement IOT to our idea that we came up with in South Africa which is the footmouse which we also thought IOT will contribute to it. I was looking forward to putting our idea to live only to find out that unfortunetely it won't work to our favour.

so after coming from a long weekend we had to think of something .So we decided to do a Call for Help button. This button would allow a disabled employee, to call for help to a responsible Employee who has a Responder. Activating the Call for Help should also be possible via a voice command.
