## Who are U?
Answer the following questions:


### What type of programming experience do you have?
I have programming experience in python,javascript,SQL,Webdevelopment and c#.But as for C# I haven't use it that much lately .

### What have you done with micro controllers? Which ones have you used?
I have a little bit of experience which i got from class with the Raspberry PI 400. We recently just completed some beginner projects where I was blinking LEDs from the ESP.

### Which single board computers do you know/have you used?
I know the RaspberryPI and Arduino, and I have used the Raspberry PI 400 well from todays' class.

### Who is a maker or part of the maker community? What do you like/would you like about it?
i think a Maker in the IoT community are DIY enthusiasts who design and build IoT devices, often using open-source approaches, fostering innovation and collaboration.

### What do you already know about IoT?
I only knew that IoT has to do with anything that includes connectivity in it .Well and i also knew that it has a big relation with Electrical components.

### What are your expectations from this class?
I expect to learn about connecting IoT software and hardware to make a meaniful connectivity between the two.


## IoT

### What does Internet of Things entail?

IoT connects everyday objects to the internet, allowing them to collect and share data for improved automation and insights.
### Domains
Some Domains that IOT devices get used for entail Smart homes, Agriculture, Industrial Automation, Automotive Industry, Security Systems, Healthcare.

### Commonly used (data) protocols
 Bluetooth, MQTT, TCP/IP and HTTP


### Typical devices
Arduino,putty, RaspberryPI, cooling systems, Heating system, Cars, Phones, Planes .

### What are the benefits of IoT?
The ability to automate processes and intelligently connecting devices. Measuring data about industrial machines and predicting upcoming Defects before they happen.

### What are the challenges?
Making different systems work together can be tough because there are so many parts to consider, like the actual hardware, the computer programs, and the places where it all runs. Finding money for IoT solutions, especially in something like healthcare, can be a real challenging. Technology is changing super fast, and what's new today might be old news tomorrow. Figuring out how to use less power while still going fast is a big deal.


### What else is noteworthy about IOT?
IoT is a big deal because it connects everything, making life more convenient and efficient. It's changing how we live and work.
