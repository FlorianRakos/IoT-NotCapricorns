# Reflection
On this day i came earlier to class before most of my of group mates.i left my back in the lecture room and i went to get expressor near by .When i got back to class the lecture already demonstrated on how the class will be driven.so for this first activity i totally worked on sometging i should have not been doing, but it was not a train smash because i easily adjusted into the the discussion. 

## Lecture reflection
The lecture was quite okay but then again on this day i failed to grasp exactly what was expected from us it was not only me but other group member were lost aswell.

## Lab reflection
Today i starterd building the voltage divider off the circuit board and that is not what we were supposed to do so i was totally lost because i feel like the scope was not clear from my side but then i moved to the other side of the pair to work with florian.

Florian was alredy working on the tasks of today so he simply explained to us how it is done although he was also struggling
