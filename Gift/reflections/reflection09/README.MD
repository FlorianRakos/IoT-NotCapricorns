## Lecture reflection
I think volker was not feeling it to ,he kept losing it and coming back to life he said too.But from my side of understanding i was able to get where he was trying to direct us and at the end of the day i was able to complete what was needed from us .

## Lab reflection
Volker went through the activities with us and i was able to complete them along side with Jorrit,he was impatient but he was able to help me knowing him he can be difficult sometimes but not in a mean way.Volker's scoper is very clear in way that you can work on your task with out being directed
