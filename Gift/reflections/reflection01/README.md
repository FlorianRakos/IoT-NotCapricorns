# Reflections
on our first day we got introduced to IoT which i though it is going to be easier for me to comprehend because i have a Digital electronics background,Guess what i lied to myself.



## Lecture reflection
The lecture was interesting ,the fact that i come from the background of digital electronics did not throw me out of idea what is going with IOT.One of the lectures demontrated to me the difference between the two. 


## Lab reflection
It was quite interesting seeing the blinks of the LEDs although i did not understand the moral of the connection.Later on asked the lecture why was he showing us all that,that is when he told me they were trying to show us how IoT works and how is everything is connected to one another.
