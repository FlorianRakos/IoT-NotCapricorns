# Reflections
ont this day i was still lost,but light started to shine on my side as the class was ongoing .For some reason i fail to unserstand the lecture from the get go ,i feel like the lecture can easily explain out task in a much simplier way.If most of the work was indivitual work i was going to fail to understand what is exactly needed for us to to but thanks to my team mate Flarian he can explain things to me much better but only if he has an idea because we both struggle to understan in most cases.

## Lecture reflection
i honestly feel like is vital for the lecture to make sure students understands the core context of that day's lecture before getting anyfuther.It much better if the student understand what it is exactly expected for him/her to do before starting the practical work for the day.

## Lab reflection
I was able  ot put together hands with florian to complete what was expected for our pair to do luckly with the help of his mere understanding we were able to finish the tasks of the day.if it was not for private enquiries directly to the lecture i doubt we could have completed our tasks
