# Reflections
On this day the lecture was not that diffucult for me as i was starting to understand and grow into the module.The day before this lecture before i went to sleep i did some research on exactly the path we learning as i was slightly off the path i was supposed to be in at the beginning of the week.we learned about data formats and i was able to grasp most of  the lecture as i was already familiar with most of the data formats.i already knew why xml is not used at this day of life but out of this day lecture i got a crystal clear idea why it was ditched to JSON."XML uses a lot of tags and attributes to represent data, which can make it more difficult to parse and understand"



## Lecture reflection
The lecture was fine at the beginning of the class before we delved into the practical part of the day .It could've been simplier if the lecture demonstrated to us that we now going to implement theory of today into practicality . 


## Lab reflection
The first two excercises of the day were easier for me and i found it intersisting as i was able to complete them.The lasst one was quite complex as i did not understand it correctlly.Withe the help of my team mate i was able to get an idea of what was required for us to do.Ater todays's session i was able to make connections in my room and complete the task and also understand it better.I watched several you tube videos that nights only to find out that we are using the pi as our broker and the input is published to ther pi and therefore teh subscriber which is the client gets the message from the publisher through the pi .It is really important for me to understand what i am working with to find it really interesting.
