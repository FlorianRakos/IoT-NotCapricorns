### General Feedback
The feedback that we got from the lectures was impresseive and music to our ears to hear espeacially to the voice  recognition Feature that we implemented on our demo. 

## Feedback for the project presentation from lectures
- Two good features are the Voice Recognition and Ability for mutliple Listeners.
- In our pitch we should act more like the Responder is actually a watch.
- The responder could have a yellow and a red LED. Red would be used for emergency cases and yellow for help cases.
- We could use a API to Amazon Alexa to publish MQTT messages.
