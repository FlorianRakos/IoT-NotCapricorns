## What will be issues scaling (system size, number of systems, management)?
* budget
* device managment
*	data management
## How can we do testing?
* User test
* Security testing
* Indivudual device testing
## What would you like to see for scaling up? (What is not so great currently?)
* Unified framework: to not have to use and learn that many programms as a begginer
* More documentation
## What role will simulator(-component)s, MQTT, and stories play?
* Simulators are crucial for testing large-scale IoT deployments without actually deploying thousands of devices. They can mimic device behavior, data transmission, and more to help understand potential issues in a scaled system.
* MQTTs role is ensuring efficient, reliable, and real-time communication, especially when scaling up.
* Stories help define the requirements and objectives of the IoT system, guiding development and testing. By understanding the desired outcome or behavior through stories, the IoT solution can be scaled and optimized appropriately.
