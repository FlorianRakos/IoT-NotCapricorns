### Lecture
Today I learned more about some Dataformats. For example I learned about XML and why it's not being used that much any more. Apparently it was hard to fit XML files to Schemes that have been created.

Also I learned that Binary Formats which used to be the way to transfer information slowly have somewhat of a comback with Dataformats like BSON which combine the strengths of JSON as well as binary data transfer.

I was also interested to hear about Publish Subscribe Systems like the MQTT format.

### Lab
In the Lab I had fun completing the first few MQTT exercises and have learned quite a bit. But as I had to go to a meeting with my bachelor thesis coach and missed some contents because of that, I had trouble implementing the more advanced exercises later on.
