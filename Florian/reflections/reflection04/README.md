This day I was not able to join for the lab session in the morning because I had a Job Interview.

However I joined in the afternoon and helped implementing the "Emergency Button" with an ESP32, Nodered and a Discordbot. I enjoyed this exercise and was keen to learn about how to use NodeRED. The only problem I ran into was that I got the Error "Used Disallowed Intents" which I didn't manage to solve and which might be because I didn't recive sufficient access rights for my Discord Bot.
