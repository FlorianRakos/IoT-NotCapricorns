## Who are U?
Answer the following questions:


### What type of programming experience do you have?
I feel confident programming. Ich have good Experience in Python, Java, Webdevelopment and Gamedevelopment.

### What have you done with micro controllers? Which ones have you used?
I have a little bit of experience with the Raspberry PI Pico. I have just completed some beginner projects where I was blinking some LEDs.

### Which single board computers do you know/have you used?
I know the RaspberryPI and Arduino, and I have used the Raspberry PI Pico.

### Who is a maker or part of the maker community? What do you like/would you like about it?
I guess a maker is someone who likes to create electronic solutions for problems or tinker around. 

### What do you already know about IoT?
I only have a basic understanding about what IoT is. I also 

### What are your expectations from this class?
I expect to learn about how to connect different Sensors with a Microcontroller and how to connect the Microcontroller with other devices and the internet.


## IoT

### What does Internet of Things entail?
The Internet of Things describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.

### Domains
Some Domains that IOT devices get used for entail Smart homes, Agriculture, Industrial Automation, Automotive Industry, Security Systems, Healthcare.

### Commonly used (data) protocols
AMQP, Bluetooth, MQTT, TCP/IP


### Typical devices
Arduino, RaspberryPI, Lawnmower, Heating system, Cars, Phones, Planes

### What are the benefits of IoT?
The ability to automate processes and intelligently connecting devices. Measuring data about industrial machines and predicting upcoming Defects before they happen.

### What are the challenges?
Connecting multiple different systems with each other is hard. High complexity due to many different things being involved (like Hardware, Software, Platforms, etc…). Financing the IoT Solutions can be hard (e.a. Healthcare Area). Technology is changing very fast, and can soon be outdated. Balancing Power Consumption and Speed.


### What else is noteworthy about IOT?
Internet of broken Things – There are a lot of IoT Applications which are very vulnerable to be hacked which could be critical in cases where it is about life and death, like Cars or Airplanes.
