## Project challenges
A big challenge whith which we wasted a lot of time was trying to get the M5 stick to work.
Another challenge was implementing the dynamic subsrciption with the IDs of help-buttons and responders.

## Feedback for the project presentation
- Two good features are the Voice Recognition and Ability for mutliple Listeners.
- In our pitch we should act more like the Responder is actually a watch.
- The responder could have a yellow and a red LED. Red would be used for emergency cases and yellow for help cases.
- We could use a API to Amazon Alexa to publish MQTT messages. (I don't really know how that would be helpful)
