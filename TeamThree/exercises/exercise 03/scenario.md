## Foot Mouse & Accessibility Software Scenario


**Company**: LoudWhisper, **Project Manager**: Roberto, **Employee**: Matthijs, **CEO**: Pieter

At LoudWhisper's Amsterdam office, Roberto struggles during a presentation due to hand tremors from Parkinson's. Every attempt to highlight a key point results in the mouse pointer jittering across the screen.

Matthijs notices Roberto's difficulties and, after the presentation, approaches Pieter with concerns about Roberto's challenges with the traditional mouse.

Pieter introduces Roberto to a mouse smoothing software specifically designed for individuals with hand tremors. This software compensates for erratic movements and can be calibrated for individual needs.

Roberto is eager to try any technology that might help him overcome his challenges.

Pieter and Roberto set a day to install and calibrate the software. Pieter guides Roberto through the settings, ensuring the software is tailored to Roberto's unique tremor patterns.

To calibrate the software, Roberto needs to move the mouse in a big circle shown on the screen, a square and a triangle, allowing the software to record and analyze the tremor patterns. Then Roberto has to press some points shown on the screen, and finally follow a moving circle for 15 seconds. A machine learning algorithm observes the patterns of Robertoâ€™s tremors from the movements Roberto makes. It uses these to set parameters for the stabilization tool.

Using the data, the software provides initial calibration suggestions. Roberto tests these, making small pointer movements to assess the smoothing's effectiveness.

Roberto notices certain instances where the smoothing is too aggressive, causing a lag in response. An algorithm adjusts the settings to find a balance between smoothing and responsiveness.

After several iterations, Roberto identifies optimal settings that provides him with enhanced control without noticeable lag.

After a week of using the new software, Roberto feels more confident during computer tasks. The pointer now moves smoothly, making his tasks less challenging.

At the next team meeting, Roberto presents with renewed confidence. The noticeable improvement in his mouse control leads to several questions from the team.

Roberto uses this opportunity to share the benefits of the mouse smoothing software, demonstrating its features and the transformative impact it has had on his daily work.

Inspired by this success, WisperTech considers implementing more inclusive tech solutions, with Roberto leading the way in advocating for greater workplace accessibility.
