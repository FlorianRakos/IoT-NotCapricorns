## Identify Security Risks 
For the next excercise we need to use our scenario to identify the security risks that can occur.

### Which security vulnerabilities did you encounter in your IoT scenarious? 
 * Device (footmouse) security and management
 * Lack of monitoring and logging
 * Lack of privacy protections
 * Unauthorized access to cloud storage
 * Insider threats (Roberto or Pieter)

### Which measures can be taken to close the vulnerabilities?
*Device Security and Management:*
 * Regular Updates: to patch any known vulnerabilities.
 * Secure Boot: to ensure that the device only boots with trusted software.
 * Hardware-based Security: such as Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) or Hardware Security Modules (HSM), for cryptographic      operations and secure key storage.
 * Remote Device Management:  to allow administrators to monitor, update, and manage devices remotely.
 * Device Authentication: Use strong authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized devices can connect to the network.
### Lack of Monitoring and Logging:
 * Enable Logging: Ensure all devices have logging capabilities enabled, capturing all relevant events and anomalies.
 * Centralized Monitoring: Use a centralized monitoring system to aggregate logs from all devices, making it easier to detect anomalies or security breaches.
 * Real-time Alerts: Implement real-time alerting mechanisms to notify administrators of suspicious activities or system failures.
