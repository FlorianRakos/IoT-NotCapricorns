Roos, a 27-year-old colleague at our company, faced a challenging situation after a life-altering accident that left her without the use of both her arms. Her desire to regain her independence in using a computer was strong. She discovered the Foot Mouse device and was determined to make it work for her.

After obtaining the Foot Mouse and installing the necessary app, Roos started the setup process, which turned out to be surprisingly straightforward, just like with any other mouse. She meticulously customized the mouse sensitivity to ensure the cursor moved precisely the way she wanted, using her foot to control it.

At first, using the Foot Mouse presented Roos with a learning curve. It was a different way of interacting with her computer, and it took some time to adapt. However, Roos was a determined individual. She practiced diligently, and soon enough, she overcame the initial challenges. The Foot Mouse quickly became an extension of her abilities, and she found herself navigating her computer with ease.

In her company Roos worked in the Marketing Team therefore she often has to write emails. Now she can easily open up the Outlook Email browser with the footmouse. Next she can start to record her voice to write out exactly the text she wants to write. Whenever there are just short texts she might as well use the keyboard with her other foot. But whenever she has to write longer texts she prefers to use the windows voice recognition tool. When she is done with her email she just presses the send Button effortlessly.

With the Foot Mouse in place, Roos experienced a newfound sense of empowerment. She could effortlessly navigate her computer, from browsing websites and managing her emails to actively participating in various projects. The Foot Mouse had given her the autonomy she so dearly longed for.

Roos' success didn't go unnoticed in the company. Her story served as an inspiration to her colleagues, many of whom were unaware of the possibilities this device could offer. Recognizing the significance of this technology, the HR department made the Foot Mouse available to anyone within the company who required it.
