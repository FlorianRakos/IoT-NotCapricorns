# Day 12
Today it was our last day of class and did the presentations of our projects. The first two groups presented their projects and showed us how they worked. I first attended the "Big Five" presentation. I enjoyed it and thought it was very inclusive. Afterwards, I attended the "Magnus perfectus" presentation. I got curious and asked them what would happen if someone shook the device. I thought it would call a ton of times but they told me that it would only call one time because they had implemented a timeout. I thought that was very smart of them.

Sandly, we could attend the "Team Rocket" presentation because it was also our turn to present. 
<br><br>
We presented for the first time to Ulno and to some members from another group. We missed Jorrit, that could be there today but managed to demonstrate our work. Ulno gave us some [feedback]() and gave us some advice for the second one.
We then did it again to Volker and to members from the other group.

Both teachers emphasized their fascination for the voice command feature. Jorrit did a very good job on that, and was a pitty he couldn't be there to explain it in detail.
