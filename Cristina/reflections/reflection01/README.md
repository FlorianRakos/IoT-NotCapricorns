# Reflections

## day 1

## Lecture reflection
Today we did an introduction to the IoT world. I used Menti.com for the first time and I really liked the dinamic it created. It helped to see all the answers from the rest of collegues in a different and very visual way. Even though i'm not used to the amount of hours of lectures, I enjoyed them and for now, I have understood everything, which is my principal objective providing I have no experience on arduino or IoT.


## Lab reflection
I was a little overwelmed by the load of activities proposed for today  but surprisingly it was fine. I teamed up with Jorrit and Luca and I have to say that Jorrit was a very good teacher and helped us a lot. During the tasks, Jorrit would present them as a challenge and Luca and I would make suggestions on how we could solve it. Jorrit answered all the questions we had, Luca wrote the steps and errors we found and afterwards I would make photos proving the solution worked. We managed to finish all the tasks for today before 5 pm.
