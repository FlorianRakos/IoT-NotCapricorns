Yesterday I was working until 1 on the morning on the portfolio because the group tasks were disorganized, so today I was a bit tired, but I finished organizing them and then made some index on the days where I have a lot of topics. I linked everything and rewrited some texts.
<br><br>
I did a ton of documentation and with Luca we explained with a lot of photos the last exercise we did with Volker while Jorrit and Florian worked on the final project.
<br><br>
Today I learnt that pressing ctrl+b on git, the texts turns bold. I knew that command for normal drive documents but I didn't know it also worked here.
<br><br>
After, Luca and I talked about tomorrow's presentation and brainstormed some ideas. We decided on explainig the senario representating it ourselves.

I've been in hyper focused mode for the hole morning and now I'm exhausted, but there was a ton of work to do on the portfolio that is finally done.
