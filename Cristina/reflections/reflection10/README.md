Today I found the tasks challenging. I managed to do most of them with the help of Wesley, Manon and Volker, the professor but I stopped at step 4 from the task in slide 105. I didn't have the knoledge to continue, and none of my teammates were in class or available to help me. I think I already did a giant effort on doing all the tasks until this one giving the nule experience I have in IoT or programming in general.

As helpful as my colleagues from other grups are, I have a lot of problems to solve and questions to answer and I don't want to be a burden when they need to work on the tasks too so I try to ask for help to a different person every time.

I go to sleep happy with the achievements made today, but wished my group teammates would collaborate more.
