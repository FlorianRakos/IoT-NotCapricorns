Today I soent the morning doing the last task my group had left which was 7c. I struggled a little bit with node-red because I couldn't fully understand what every node was doing and where was the error but after a while and a little help from Judith and Jesper, I made it.
I had to leave the classroom because I had a meeting and after I feel ill so I stayed at my dorm resting
