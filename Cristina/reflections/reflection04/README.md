#Day 4
Today I wasn't at my 100%, but I did what I could.
First, we did yesterday's last activity because we couldn't finish it. It took a while and, when we had it, Gift rebuilt yeserdays activity into node-red and then connected it to hardware.

On the afternoon i wasn't feeling very well so I decided to rest in my dorm to be better the next day while my team mates tried to do the second task of the day without many success.
