Today we started the security part of IoT with Volker. The theory on itself sounded like chinese for me, but thanks to the questions and ChatGPT, I was able to have a basic overall understanding.

It was a tough day, a lot of new concepts that I had no idea about. ChatGPT was my best friend today because I proceded to ask him every single question that I had, and all the concepts I didn't know.
I spent a lot of time (3-4 hours) stuck, trying to do the last task and I gave up on one of the steps, because the programm (Putty) wouldn't recognise the command pscp and there was no way on fixing it.
