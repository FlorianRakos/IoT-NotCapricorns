# Reflections

## day 2

## Lecture reflection
Today we created a story with some personas. Luca and I took the personas made in the previous module in Spain and got inspired on making the story. Because our toolkit has 4 personas, our half-group included two of them and the other one included the other two. 
Besides that, we didn't do much theory


## Lab reflection
Today I was very lost. The tasks given weren't clear and most of them didn't work as told in the statement. At the beginning Jorrit was explaining everything he was doing to Luca and I to understand it but, because I don't have any previous experience on arduino nor this programming languages I couldn't comprehend what was happening. I ended up writing the documentation for the group but I felt useless. I feel like from yesterday to today, the level has increased exponencially and I don't have the knowledge to follow. I found interesting that even the people who are studying IoT in their carreer, struggled a lot doing a very "basic" activity.
