reflect about iot given the first week working with it and previous knloedge and experience that i have none

Gift and I misunderstood the first task and, after doing some reserach on the commands we had to do research of, we started trying to build the device with the rfid reader, PWM, a servo motor, the ultrasonic distance sensor and single rgb LED. We tried hard for 1 to 2 hours with the help form the teacher and then we realised we didn't have to build it. Ulno told us that we could save the progress we had made because we would build that same device some days after, but we were a bit disapointed on ourselves for not understanding the activity and for have "waised" that much time, although it is not wasted because we will do that activity sometime in the near future.

After that, the other half of the group was doing the second activity and didn't want us to join them because we would distract them and not all of us could work at the same time on the gateway so I invested most of my time doing documentation here in git in the team three folder about the previous days and doing the index.  After, my team would explain me how they did the activities and finally, I managed to successfully do the second task with Xavi's help.
