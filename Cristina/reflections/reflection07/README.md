# Day 7
Today I spent most of my morning working on the team documentation on the team with Luca. We couldn't modify the document at the same time, so we took turns and cheered eachother up along the way.
<br><br>
I learnt new markdown like: < br >< br > without the spaces in between to skip to the next line. 
<br><br>
I still hate markdown, especially because one capital or small leter can make one link useless, and I come from the design field, so that is another reason in itself. I find this language to be the contrary to aesthetic.
<br><br>
We also struggled to work at the same time, but that is apparently because we don't have git set up the right way.
<br><br>
In the afternoon, Jorrit updated me on the progress of our project, and I decided to try to do a task by myself. I struggled a lot in the beginning because I didn't remember the basic steps to set the gateway, so I had to revise the tutorial on that but then I started with the task. 
<br><br>
Not long into it, I had a recurrent error show up, and couldn't find the cause, so I asked Manon for help because none of the members of my group where in the class on that moment. We spent a while trying possible solutions until Jesper suggested a missing ;
Not only that, but Manon also realized that there was the wrong device on the node.conf.
The few people left in class decided to leave, so I did too, and I set up everything again in my dorm.
There, Judit and Xavi joined me and together managed to complete the [activity](/TeamThree/Ulrichs%20Lab%20Tasks.md#7b-analog-touch-sensor).
<br><br>
Today a lot of people helped me, but I only asked for it once. The other times, people saw me struggling and decided to help me. I really appreciate that because I'm stubborn and many times I want to resolve a problem by myself and obsess with that idea, when it would be easier to ask for help and solve an obstacle quicker.
<br><br>
I enjoyed today. I didn't feel overwelmed and I did a lot of work.
