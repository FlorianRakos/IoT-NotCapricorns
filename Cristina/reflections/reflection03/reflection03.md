Yesterday I ended up very lost, and today I woke up with an opened mind and determined to do and understand everything I could. The theory today was fairly simple but because the subject is new for me I used ChatGPT to explain it to me in different ways to understand it fully.
The series of tasks propsed for today were quite different from yesterday, and, even though they were more difficult than yesterday's ones, I had a better understanding today. 

In the first task, Luca and I had some fun sending messages to each other throu the IoTempower gateway using MQTT. Not much later, all my group were sending messages to each other.

The next series of tasks were far more complicated, but because I was able to do the first one without help, I was confident to start. The members of my group weren't feeling well, not on the mood to work or doing other things, and I needed help to start, so I joined Jesper and Roan, than kindly accepted me in their group and helped me set up the virtual environment. Jesper answered all my questions and explained me what was happening on every step. I really don't think I would have made it that far without his help. 

After the long break, Jorrit joined me and we created the two scripts that we were missing to complete the MQTT simulator task. After that, we started to build the two simulators on hardware but when we connected the esp32 my computer wouldn't recognise it. We had to install the driver and, when the installment finished, my computer restared and all we han on the computer terminal got lost. It wasn't the end of the world because all the scripts were saved but it was late and we didn't have time to finish the last task so we called it a day.

Today I feel much better than yesterday. I felt useful and heard. I take for today that if I need help and I dont find it in my group, I can ask for it out there, to other people willing to help.
