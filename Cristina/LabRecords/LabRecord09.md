# Day 9
## Learn about OpenWRT
I accessed the WEB interface of Open WRT and searched for the symbolic host name of the lan interface address that was OpenWrt
Then I installed opkg update on PuTTY. On the first try the resource was temporarily unavailable because I tried to updated at the same time at Jorrit. When he finished, I tried again and it upgraded correctly.
I created a nano so that the packages get installed in the router.

### Where are the remote package repositories configured?
in the /etc/opkg/distfeeds.conf file and /etc/opkg.conf file

## Prepare Installation of the Package mqttbroker
