## MQTT exploration (different tools, computers/network nodes, and wildcards)
I had so much fun sending [messages](/TeamThree/Ulrichs%20Lab%20Tasks.md#4a-mqtt-basics) to my team mates.

## MQTT integration
I did this [exercise](/TeamThree/Ulrichs%20Lab%20Tasks.md#4b-mqtt-integration) by myself, with the help of Jesper.

## MQTT simulators
I started this [exercise](/TeamThree/Ulrichs%20Lab%20Tasks.md#4c-mqtt-simulators) alone, but then Jorrit joined and colaborated

## MQTT on microcontroller
Here is the last [activity](/TeamThree/Ulrichs%20Lab%20Tasks.md#4d-mqtt-on-microcontroller) from today, that we couldn't finish before the class ended and did on day 4.

Steps, comments, problems and proff in the links above.
