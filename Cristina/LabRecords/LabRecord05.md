# Day 5
## Device Control with IoTempower
Today we started making some documentationon the IoTempower Services and Commands and, after that, Gift and I misunderstood task 6.a2, and after writing the documentation, we started to implement it. It was a mistake that made us consume a lot of time.
When we noticed and tried to keep up with the rest of the group, they had already done a lot of steps and, I could comprehend what they were doing. I focused on doing the portfolio and at the end of the class, Xavi explained me how to do the activity 6.b, the first node and I was able to complete it. 
The tasks made today are [HERE](/TeamThree/Ulrichs%20Lab%20Tasks.md#6-device-control-with-iotempower)
