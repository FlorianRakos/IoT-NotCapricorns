Today I spent most of my time working on the teamThree portfolio and in the afternoon I did task 7.b by myself
I build a touch sensor based on the analog port with IoTempower on an Wemos D1 Mini and an attached cable that uses a Node-RED flow to generate pressed and released messages on MQTT.
Explained with details and photos [HERE](/TeamThree#7b-analog-touch-sensor)
