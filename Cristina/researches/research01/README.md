## Who are U?
Answer the following questions:

### What type of programming experience do you have?
I have some experience on html, xml and processing

### What have you done with micro controllers? Which ones have you used?
I have no experience with micro controllers

### Which single board computers do you know/have you used?
I have no experience

### Who is a maker or part of the maker community? What do you like/would you like about it?
I am not part of a maker community or 3d printing, even though we have a 3d printer at home.

### What do you already know about IoT?
I have a general idea of what IoT is but anyting in detail

### What are your expectations from this class?
In this classes i’ll try to don’t get lost and learn as many things as I can


## IoT
We asked the following questions after seeing the Bosch and TIA videos

### What does Internet of Things entail?
Internet of Things refers as the interconnection of everyday objects and devices to the internet, allowing them to send and receive data. 

### Domains
* Smart Home: includes all the devices and systems used in residences to enhance comfort, security, and energy efficiency.
    * This domain usually includes: smart thermostats, smart lighting systems, smart security cameras and locks  and voice-activated smart assistants like Amazon Echo or Google Home
* Industrial IoT (IIoT): application of IoT technologies in manufacturing and industrial settings. Devices and systems in this domain aim to improve operational efficiencies, safety, and maintenance predictability. 
    * This domain usually includes connected machinery that reports its operational status in real-time, sensors that monitor environmental conditions in factories and systems that predict when machinery will require maintenance or repair
* Healthcare: The healthcare domain leverages IoT for patient monitoring, personalized treatment, and improving overall patient care. 
    * This domain usually includes wearable health monitors (that track vital statistics like heart rate, oxygen levels, or glucose levels), remote patient monitoring systems (that allow healthcare professionals to monitor patients outside of traditional healthcare settings) and smart pill bottles that notify patients when it's time to take their medication


### Commonly used (data) protocols
Two commonly used data protocols are:
    * HTTP/HTTPS: Used by web browsers to request and display web pages.
    * TCP/IP: The fundamental suite of protocols that powers the Internet.


### Typical devices
* Smart Thermostats (e.g., Nest Learning Thermostat): These devices allow users to remotely adjust the temperature of their homes using smartphones. They can also learn the user's patterns and adjust heating or cooling accordingly for energy efficiency.
* Smart Lights (e.g., Philips Hue): These are lighting systems that can be controlled via smartphone applications, voice commands through smart assistants, or automation routines. Users can change the color, brightness, and even set schedules for the lights.
* Smart Oven: lets you control it from the phone from anywhere. It also has a camera that lets you visualise the interior of the oven.
* Smart roomba: you can turn it on or off from your phone wherever you are


### What are the benefits of IoT?
  * Iot lets you have more freedom because you can control devices out of the house. For example, we can do chores from the distance. 
  * It makes our life easier
the devices are smaller than before
  * it can help companies to be more effective and productive
  * Predictive maintenance: knowing when a machine is going to fail before it does


### What are the challenges?
  * The market did not accept m2m
  * Tecnology is not as advanced as we would like
  * The devices on the market are not always secure
  * Choosing a network: every device has different needs
  * Battery life
