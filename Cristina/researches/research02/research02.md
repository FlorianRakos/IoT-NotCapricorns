## Architecture and Terminology of IoT
  * Internet: The global network infrastructure that allows IoT devices to communicate with each other and with remote servers or services over the web.
  * Server: A centralized computer or system that stores and processes data and manages the communication and interactions between IoT devices.
  * Cloud (Computing): Remote servers and data centers that provide storage, processing, and other services for IoT applications, enabling scalability and accessibility from anywhere.
  * Edge (Computing): Processing and data analysis that occurs close to IoT devices, reducing latency and minimizing data transfer to the cloud.
  * Fog (Computing): An intermediate layer between edge and cloud computing, providing localized processing and decision-making capabilities, particularly useful for time-sensitive applications.
  * Swarm: A network of interconnected IoT devices or agents that work together to accomplish a common goal, often with decentralized decision-making.
  * Things: IoT devices, sensors, and objects that collect and transmit data to enable automation and smart functionality.
  * Gateway: A device that connects IoT devices to the internet or a local network, often serving as a bridge to relay data to servers or the cloud.
  * Nodes: Individual devices or components within an IoT network, including sensors, actuators, and other connected elements.
