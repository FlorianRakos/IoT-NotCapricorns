# Research records 09
We started the lesson analising our IoT scenario to find vulnerabilities and then figuring out measures that could fix them, check them out [HERE](/TeamThree/Volkers%20Part.md#identify-security-risks)

##### These are some notes I took from the other groups:
  * mqtt broker the password is not very secure
  * Data transfer is not encrypted
  * node red is badly passworded --> but you can change that

Then we learned about chain trust searching and answering this [questions]()
We did the same with the [DH]() and [RSA]() key exchange

##### DH key exchange notes:
Even if you listen you can not figure out the data. Only the public key is given. The private key uncryptes the message
The main difference with the two exchanges is that HD uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt, and in RSA the key to encrypt is not the same as the one to decrypt

## Lab tasks
After, we proceded to start learning and working with [OpenWrt](/Cristina/LabRecords/LabRecord09.md)
