Today we reflected on scaling and testing IoT and I made the following notes:
## Scaling and Testing
### 1. What will be issues scaling up (system size, number of systems, management)?
* Data Management
* Power Management
* Security Concerns
* Device Management
* Interoperability 

### 2. How can we do testing?
* User Experience or User Acceptance Testing
* Simulations:
  * Device Simulators
  * Network Simulators
* Load and Stress Testing
* Data Ingestion Testing
* Performance Testing
* Security Testing:
* Failover and Recovery Testing
* Upgrade and Update Testing

### 3. What would you like to see for scaling up? (What is not so great currently?)
* Unified framework: Not have to use that many different programs

### 4. What role will play simulator(-component)s, MQTT, and stories?
Simulators are crucial for testing large-scale IoT deployments without actually deploying thousands of devices. They can mimic device behavior, data transmission, and more to help understand potential issues in a scaled system.

MQTTs role is central in ensuring efficient, reliable, and real-time communication, especially when scaling up.

Stories help define the requirements and objectives of the IoT system, guiding development and testing. By understanding the desired outcome or behavior through stories, the IoT solution can be scaled and optimized appropriately.
