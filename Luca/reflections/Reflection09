##Day 9 Reflection

Today we started with Volker his part. I was hoping for an easy beginning so I could follow along again and not be lost like I was during the parts from Ulrich.
The theory was a little bit understandle. I followed along, but some things were unclear. I researched them using a trusty friend called "ChatGPT". He managed to explain it in a more dummy way and I understood most of it.

Although I understood most of the theory, I dindnt manage to finish all the tasks. I will have to do them tomorrow, however I was proud of myself. I managed to follow along for a long time and I understood most of it.
