##Day 12 Reflection

Today was presentation day. I wasnt not nervous at all and ready to do my best. We had to do our presentation without our expert in IOT, Jorrit. He sadly had to leave to get his broken down car from Spain. 
Before we started we discussed what we were going to talk about. Within my group I decided to start, explain our index, our company, our actors and how they were used in the scenario. This was a big part of the presentation to understand why we did our project and how it worked. I also had the most knowledge about this part because I was one of the 2 people who created them and thought of the situation.

We first attended the Big Five presentation. This was an interesting one. I already knew a lot about this project because I helped Wesley with testing and thinking about what he could add. It was a good presentation and I asked a question in the end to make sure that I knew how they were planning to use it in the future.
Then we attended the Magnus Perfectus presentation. I didn't know a lot about this project. I knew about their idea and what they were doing but not their end product. I also asked this a group because I was interested in the way it worked. They explained something about being able to move the m5 stick and I was wondering what would happen if they dropped it, shook it or moved it while it was on the table. They tried it and it didn't do anything, I was impressed.

Our presentations went well. We got a lot of good comments and both the teachers thought our idea was creative and was a good project for further improvements. They were also amazed by the fact that we had a voice recogniction command, because that was very usefull for someone that has no arms.
