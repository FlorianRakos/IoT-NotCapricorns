##Day 7 Reflections
Today Cristina and I worked on the team documentation. It was a bit hard, because we couldn't work on it at the same time, but we made it work. It was also a bit depressing. We tried to keep each other motivated the whole day but working on the document for a whole day was getting boring.
Cristina and I asked Manon for a lot of help because she had already used github before. She learned us some usefull tricks to use and we introduced those to the group markdown.
Both Cristina and I havent worked with Github a lot so we really felt like some kind of idiots when we didnt know some things, but Manon her help was usefull.

After all of this I went to my room to recharge myself and in the evening I continued with editing the documentation and making links for the photos.
