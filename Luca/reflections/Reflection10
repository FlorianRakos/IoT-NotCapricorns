##Day 10 Reflection

The tasks got very hard today. It was something else than yesterday. I tried the first couple tasks but the tasks in the end were very hard. I tried to look at some things that Cristina and Jorrit where doing, but I couldn't follow along anymore.
I decided to finish the documentation and make sure we didn't need to do this in the last 2 days. My group was busy with the tasks and me looking over their shoulder wouldn't help them.
