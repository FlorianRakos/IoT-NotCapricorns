#Day 4 
This day was a hard one. The motivation was gone. I really didnt enjoy the last 3 days and was not looking forward to another 2,5 weeks. Cristina finished the task from yesterday with Jesper and i decided to finish the documentation and put the pictures in a right format and the right place.
At the and of the day we were trying to complete another task with everyone but Cristina. I tried my best to follow along but i ended up just documenting us not completing it.
It was again a day where i felt lost.
