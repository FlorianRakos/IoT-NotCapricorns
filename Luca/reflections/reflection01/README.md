# Reflections

## week 1

## Lecture reflection
The lecturers are very good. It is very nice that they both speak with a lot of pasion about the subject. My only problem is that they are going to fast. I don't understand a lot. Most tasks are very hard for someone that does not have any experience with this. I spent a lot of time on figuring out what to do and that makes it very boring for myself. It does not help that I don't like IoT at all. IoT is split in 2 subjects at Fontys, it is Technology and Infrastructure. These were both my worst subjects and the ones that I really hate. So when we got here I had a little spark of hope that it was not that bad, but I really don't like it. It has nothing to do with the way the lecturers are teaching, it just has to do with my interests in IT. 

I am trying my best to complete tasks, but I need the help of my classmates for most task and that results in them not being able to do their tasks so I won't disturb them to much.


## Lab reflection
The first day was already a drop in the deep sea. I really hated it. I don't like to play around with wires and small things. I had a 8 week course when I started my education, but every knowledge that I had of this is gone. I didn't remember anything. So I partnered up with Cristina, she was in the same struggle. We tried to do most things by discussing it with eachother. Sadly, we had to ask Jorrit for help a couple times, because he is a Technology student and has had more experience with this. 
We completed the tasks for the day, but we did do it in a different structure. Jorrit was our (Cristina and I) teacher. He told us what to do, and we came with suggestions on what to do. I wrote down the steps, and Cristina did them. This worked pretty well, we managed to finish all the tasks we had to do for day 1.
