##Day 6 reflections
Today we started of with answering some questions about IOT.
After that I had to work on my PDP for the Global Minor. Jorrit, Cristina and Florian were working on some tasks, and I sometimes looked with them what they were doing, but Cristina was already documenting most of it so they didnt need me.
I also helped Cristina with an error that she had. I looked with her at her code, and after a long while we couldnt figure it out. We asked Jesper for help and he also didn't see the problem, until we realised that we missed some punctuation. This was really dumb of us, but eventually it worked.
