##Day 11 Reflection
Today I needed to get busy. Cristina told me that she did some organizing and she realized that we were missing some excercises and it was not very organized at some parts. I knew the disorganized part because I didn't come to that part yet. 
I spent the whole day working on documentation with Cristina and we added the excercises and pictures that we were still missing. We worked together very well. 
After the documentation we aslo discussed how we were going to present our product. We changed our scenario so that it is more corresponding to our final product. We changed some actors in the scenario, because we forgot that some couldn't do certain tasks.

In the evening I created the presentation. I worked till very late so that we had a good structure and we could give a very good presentation. This is one of my strenghts so I decided to make sure everyone could do their own part.
