# Reflections

## day 2

## Lecture reflection
Today me and Cristina created a story that used our already created persona's. I made these in Spain and we both decided to use them again, so the whole story would be complete and it would look more like we implemented it.

## Lab reflection
Today was a mess. I managed to follow it yesterday, but today I was lost. The tasks that we got were vague and it didnt work. Jorrit tried to explain it to me and Cristina, but it was hopeless. We both didnt have any experience with the things we used (for this case it was the arduino) so we didnt know what to do.
Me and Cristina both did some documentation and finished some work from Spain. The both of us felt very lost. It felt like the level went from level 1 to level 10. It didnt feel right.
