To be honest. I hated this module. I felt lost the whole time. I didn't know what I was doing because everything went to fast. This was way to hard for someone who has had no experience at all.
In the beginning i was hopeful but my hope disappeared quickly. I didn't see any connection to what I want to do in the future so i decided to focus on the things where i could still be useful for my group.
I was not planning to let them down and didnt want to let this module get to me. But at some moments it did. There was no motivation to go to school on a lot of the days, but i still went. The days drained my energy because of me trying to follow something and then ending up with documentation everyday. It was boring and exhausting.
The lectures were still interesting, those were not the problem. But it was just the fact that it went to fast and was not directed at people that didnt understand anything about IOT.
Both the teachers were nice and they spoke with a lot of passion. I liked that about them, but the passion also caused them to go to fast, which was bummer. But I know for sure that this module was very interesting and useful for people that already understoon some things of IOT.
