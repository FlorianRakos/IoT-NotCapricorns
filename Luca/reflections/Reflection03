## day 3
## Lesson reflection
Today I really didnt want to go to school. I was scared of what was to come. If yesterday was already like this, how would today be. 
We started with some explanations, those were understandable, but i did need to ask some things from Wesley and Jesper, and i also had to consult ChatGPT sometimes.

## Lab reflection
The tasks from today were more doable, in the beginning i didnt really follow them, but eventually i decided to do them together with Cristina. She and Wesley helped me alot. Cristina and I managed to send messages to each other through the IOTempower gateway using MQTT.
The next task put me in a dark place. I didnt know how to do it and i felt lost. I decided to work on our group documentation and my own PDP. I told Cristina that she should try to work with someone who knows what they are doing, because she really wanted to understand it. She eventually teamed up with Roan and Jesper who are both already experienced with IOT. 
At the end of the day Jorrit and Cristina finished some scripts and I took a few notes about what they did and they sent me screenshots to add to the group document. I tried to follow along but it was very complicated.
